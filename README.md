A couple of algorithm exercises to level up with. Sourced from different sites/tests. 
1. Array game: increment all array elements except one till they are equal.
2. Lottery Coupons: find the number of ways to choose the maximum winning combination split amongst the largest number of possible winners. 
3. Error Digit Range: find the difference between the possible maximum and minimum reconstructions of a number entered into a system that misinterprets any of its digits. 
4. Natural Number Summation: ind the number of possible consecutive number summations that add up to a given number N.
