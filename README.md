#### Algorithms Practice

A couple of algorithm exercises to level up with. Sourced from different sites/tests. 
1. __Array game__: increment all array elements except one till they are equal.
2. __Lottery Coupons__: find the number of ways to choose the maximum winning combination split amongst the largest number of possible winners. 
3. __Error Digit Range__: find the difference between the possible maximum and minimum reconstructions of a number entered into a system that misinterprets any of its digits. 
4. __Natural Number Summation__: find the number of possible consecutive number summations that add up to a given number N. 
5. __Most Free Time__: calculate the most free time between events in a given day.
6. __Minimum Cost Problem__: find the total minimum cost incurred by students buying pencils. 
7. __Maximum Reach__: In a given set of buildings, take turns counting the number of moves it takes to jump to the next highest building starting with the 1st building in the 1st iteration till all the buildings are done. 
8. __Data Structure__: Implement a data structure that supports these operations to: evict, add, get, remove and exit. 
9. __Happy Number__: Write an algorithm to determine if a number is happy, i.e. the recursive sum of the squares of its digits results into 1. 
10. __Single Digit__: Find the digit that appears once in an array.
11. __Move Zeroes__: Move all the zeroes in the array to the end without creating a new array, and maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
12. __Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks II__: Given an array of prices of stocks. Determine when to buy and sell in order to achieve maximum profit.
