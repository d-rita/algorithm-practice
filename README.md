#### Algorithms Practice

A couple of algorithm exercises to level up with. Sourced from different sites/tests. 
1. __Array game__: increment all array elements except one till they are equal.
2. __Lottery Coupons__: find the number of ways to choose the maximum winning combination split amongst the largest number of possible winners. 
3. __Error Digit Range__: find the difference between the possible maximum and minimum reconstructions of a number entered into a system that misinterprets any of its digits. 
4. __Natural Number Summation__: find the number of possible consecutive number summations that add up to a given number N. 
5. __Most Free Time__: calculate the most free time between events in a given day.
