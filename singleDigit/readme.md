#### Single Digit

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

__Note:__ Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

__Example 1:__

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

__Example 2:__

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
